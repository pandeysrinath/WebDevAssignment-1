    <p style="margin-top: 6%">I like to solve a wide variety of real-life problems and at the same time I graduated in B.Sc Mathematics, before taking admission in my Master of Computer Applications course at MANIT, I only knew a little bit about computer programming, because I belong to a non-computer background but eventually I started C programming under the guidance of Anirban Sir, he taught each and every important concept of C in depth. He teaches this Computer Language excellently. I wanted to learn computer programming since my childhood but due to some reasons I was not able to study this subject smoothly but I am sure that after completing my MCA course, I have become a complete master in computer programming. I will get it</p>
